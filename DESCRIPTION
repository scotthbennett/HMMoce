Description: Improved analysis of marine animal movement data by implementing
    a state-space hidden Markov model (HMM) to improve position estimates. Position
    estimates are derived by comparing electronic tag data (from tags deployed on
    marine animals, typically fish) to three-dimensional oceanographic data.
