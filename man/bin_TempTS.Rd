\title{Convert time series to PDT-like data for use in HMMoce.}
\usage{
bin_TempTS(ts, out_dates, bin_res = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{is data frame of time series data. Required inputs cols are Date (POSIX), Depth and Temperature. Note that its up to you to use the appropriate columns with these names. For example, Microwave X-tags can have a "Corrected Depth" column. You should re-name that to "Depth" and provide it as input here.}

\item{out_dates}{is POSIX vector of desired dates as output.}

\item{bin_res}{is numeric indicating desired depth bin resolution. Default is 8 
to match native PDT format on WC tags; however, theres no reason why this 
couldnt be higher resolution, especially if consider we later match this to
a 3D product such as HYCOM that is higher depth resolution (usually).}
}
\value{
a dataframe of summarized depth-temperature information that can be used for likelihood calculations in HMMoce
}
\description{
\code{bin_TempTS} converts time series data (such as from MT tags) to PDT-like data for use in HMMoce
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
tsFile <- system.file("extdata", "141259-Series.csv", package = "HMMoce")
ts <- read.table(tsFile, sep=',', header=T)
ts$Date <- as.POSIXct(paste(ts$Day, ts$Time), format='\%d-\%b-\%Y \%H:\%M:\%S', tz='UTC')
ts <- ts[,c('Date','Depth','Temperature')]

## generate example daily summary of depth-temp profiles
pdt_dates <- seq.POSIXt(tag, pop, by = 'day') 

## generate depth-temp summary from time series
pdt <- bin_TempTS(ts, out_dates = pdt_dates, bin_res = 25)
pdt <- pdt[,c('Date','Depth','MinTemp','MaxTemp')]
}
}
