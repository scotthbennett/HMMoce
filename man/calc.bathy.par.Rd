\title{Calculate Bathymetry-based likelihood in parallel}
\usage{
calc.bathy.par(mmd, bathy.grid, dateVec, focalDim = NULL, sens.err = 5,
  lik.type = "max", ncores = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mmd}{is dataframe containing at least cols: "Date" (POSIXct) and "MaxDepth" in meters (positive values are wet)}

\item{bathy.grid}{is raster of bathymetry. If the minimum bathymetry values are < 0, the function automatically converts in-water values to positive and masks land.}

\item{dateVec}{is vector of POSIXct dates for each time step of the likelihood}

\item{focalDim}{is integer for dimensions of raster::focal used to calculate
sd() of env grid cell. If left to NULL (default), this dimension will
approximately incorporate 0.25 degrees.}

\item{sens.err}{is numeric indicating the percent sensor error in the tag-measured max depth. This allows some uncertainty when calculating the integral for the likelihood and doesnt have to necessarily reflect the actual sensor error. Default is 5 percent.}

\item{lik.type}{is character indicating which likelihood type to use in the bathymetry calculation. Options are dnorm (a traditional likelihood bounded by tag measurement +/- sens.err; experimental) or max ("one-sided" likelihood >= tag-measured max depth; DEFAULT). The latter choice acts more like a mask in that it doesnt allow likelihoods in water shallower than the max depth for each time point.}

\item{ncores}{is integer indicating number of cores used in this parallel
computation. Defaults to using a detection function that chooses cores for
you.}
}
\value{
likelihood is raster brick of likelihood surfaces representing
matches between tag-based depth and a bathymetry field
}
\description{
\code{calc.bathy.par} compares tag max depth to bathymetry grid and calculates
likelihoods in parallel
